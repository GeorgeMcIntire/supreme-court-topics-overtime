  "body": "## Supreme Court Topics Over Time\r\n\r\nThis is a project by @emilyinamillion that utilizes topic modeling with Non Negative Matrix factorization (python) and has an accompanying D3.js visualization. Read the blog post [here](http://www.emilyinamillion.me/blog/2016/7/13/visualizing-supreme-court-topics-over-time)!\r\n\r\nIf you came here for the topic modeling,[one of my ipython notebooks](https://github.com/emilyinamillion/supreme-court-topics-overtime/blob/master/pipeline/Step4_pipeline_Model-testing.ipynb) walks through the other algorithms I tried as well as my reasoning for why I settled on NMF.\r\n\r\nIf you came here for the D3.js, the visualization folder is the entire contents of the live D3.js visualization currently available on Bl.ocks. \r\n\r\n:v:\r\n",
